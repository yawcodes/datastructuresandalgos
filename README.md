## Introduction

In this repository, I have documented the implementation details and provided working examples of various data structures and algorithms using Java. Each concept is supported by source code and a README explaining the fundamentals.

## Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures organize data elements in a linear fashion. The implementations provided here cover:

- Arrays TBD
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues

## Hash Maps

Implementations of hash maps show the efficiency of storing and retrieving data using key-value pairs. Covered topics include:

- Hash Functions
- Collision Resolution Strategies
- Time Complexities

## Algorithmic Concepts

The backbone of algorithm design, such as:

- Recursion
- Divide and Conquer TBD
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## Nonlinear Data Structures

Data structures for representing hierarchical data are covered here:

- Binary Trees
- Heaps
- Tries TBD

## Sorting Algorithms

Different methods to sort data are implemented:

- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

## Graph Data Structures

Various ways to represent and traverse graphs, as well as finding the shortest path:

- Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Search Algorithm TBD

## Usage

To run any implementation, make sure you have Java installed on your machine. Navigate to the sub-folder containing the Java files and compile and run the Java file using the following commands:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
